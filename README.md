# Santander
Kaggle challenge: Santander

## Approach
In this notebook we use the following concepts and methods:
- Undersampling and oversampling. 
- Outlier detection.
- Anomaly detection with autoencoders. 
- Gaussian Naive Bayes. 
- Gradient boosted trees (XGB and LGBM), with grod-search and cross-validation.
- Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.
- Model blending for improved AUC scores.
